# TODO
# You only need the following if your plugin requires specific OctoPrint versions or
# specific operating systems to function - you can safely remove the whole
# "compatibility" block if this is not the case.

compatibility:

  # List of compatible versions
  #
  # A single version number will be interpretated as a minimum version requirement,
  # e.g. "1.3.1" will show the plugin as compatible to OctoPrint versions 1.3.1 and up.
  # More sophisticated version requirements can be modelled too by using PEP440
  # compatible version specifiers.
  #
  # You can also remove the whole "octoprint" block. Removing it will default to all
  # OctoPrint versions being supported.

  octoprint:
  - 1.9.0

  # List of compatible operating systems
  #
  # Valid values:
  #
  # - windows
  # - linux
  # - macos
  # - freebsd
  #
  # There are also two OS groups defined that get expanded on usage:
  #
  # - posix: linux, macos and freebsd
  # - nix: linux and freebsd
  #
  # You can also remove the whole "os" block. Removing it will default to all
  # operating systems being supported.

  - linux

# OctoPrint Accelerometer
Measure your printers' resonance without printing any test object.
This plugin helps to measure the resonance for the [Input Shaping](https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M593.html).

## How does it work?
OctoPrint Accelerometer uses a [microcontroller](https://github.com/3dp-accelerometer) to fetch samples from an ordinary acceleration sensor.
All the samples are then Fast Fourier transformed and plotted so that dominant frequencies can be easily spotted.
This plugin encapsulates the controller API and provides a simple UI to configure all required parameters.

The controller asserts that no sample is lost and that all samples are taken with an equidistant separation.

## Setup

1. Open the OctoPrint Web Interface
2. Open the Settings using the ðŸ”§ (wrench) icon in the top right header
3. Open the Plugin Manager in the selection menu on the left-side
4. Click on the "+ Get More" button
5. Search for OctoPrint Accelerometer
6. Click Install on the OctoPrint Accelerometer Plugin
7. Restart OctoPrint once Installation is completed
8. The full installation guide/quickstart can be found here: [QuickStart Guide](https://github.com/3dp-accelerometer/controller)

## Configuration

Once you have successfully installed OctoPrint Accelerometer plugin,
you should configure the settings. To configure the settings:

1. Open the OctoPrint Web Interface
2. Open the Settings using the ðŸ”§ (wrench) icon in the top right header
3. Scroll down to the Plugin Settings in selection menu on the left-side and select "Accelerometer"
4. Follow the setup guide on the official [GitHub](https://github.com/3dp-accelerometer/controller) page.
